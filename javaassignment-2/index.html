You know how old your cat is in human years, but how old is your cat in cat years? You can create a calculation to figure that out!
Create a function called calculateCatAge that takes one argument: the age of your cat
Estimate your cat's age using a conversion rate of one human year to seven cat years
The outcome should be displayed on the screen as follows: "Your cat is ## years old in cat years!"
Call the function three times with three distinct values */
